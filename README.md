# Wedding Guest List Management App

An Application for a user to manage the guest list for a wedding.

## Description

I am engaged to be married and thought about how I would manage my guest list. I recently did a SQL and SQL ORM course. So I thought it would be perfect for me to apply what I have learned into an application that can help me. This application uses the REST API convention with full CRUD operations. Currently still in development.
